Neural OS: A Simulated Operating System 💻

Neural OS is a lightweight, interactive operating system simulation built entirely within the browser. It demonstrates a conceptual architecture where different "backend" services (simulated by various programming languages like Python, Java, Go, and C++) handle specific tasks, while a core JavaScript engine orchestrates the UI and interactions.

Features ✨

Home Screen: A centralized launcher for all installed applications. 🏠

Persistent Data: User data for installed apps, file system, and browser history is saved using Firebase Firestore, ensuring your progress is retained across sessions. 💾

Dynamic App Management (Simulated):

Browser: Simulate web browsing and search using AI-generated content. Keeps a history of visited sites. 🌐

Email: Compose, send, view, and delete simulated emails. 📧

Photos (Gallery & Camera): View simulated images and capture new "photos" using your device's camera (if permitted). 🖼️ 📷

File System: Navigate a simulated file system, view text file contents, and create/edit/delete files/folders. All changes are persistent. 🗂️

Settings: Toggle dark/light mode, adjust simulated display brightness and volume, and manage simulated network settings. ⚙️

Google Assistant: Interact with an AI assistant for general queries (responses generated by AI). 🗣️

Play Store: Browse a list of simulated apps, view their details, and "install" them to your home screen. App installations are persistent. 🛍️

Google Maps: Get AI-generated, simulated directions between two locations. 🗺️

Weather App: Get AI-generated, current weather reports for specified cities. ☁️

Game App: A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game to demonstrate interactive app logic. 🎮

Travel App: Search for simulated flight options between origin and destination cities using AI-generated data. ✈️

Sound Recorder: Record and play back audio (in-memory only). 🎤

Notes App: Create and save text notes with persistence. 📝

Calculator App: A basic functional calculator. 🧮

Technologies Used 🚀

Frontend:

HTML: For structuring the OS interface. 📄

Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a modern look. 🎨

JavaScript: The core logic for UI interaction, state management, and orchestration of backend service simulations. 💡

Backend Services (Simulated):

Python (Conceptual): Representing AI services (e.g., content generation for browser, assistant responses, weather, app descriptions, map directions, flight search). Calls to the Gemini API are made from JavaScript to simulate this. 🐍

Java (Conceptual): Representing application management (e.g., installing and launching apps). ☕

C++ (Conceptual): Representing low-level kernel services (e.g., file system operations). ➕

Go (Conceptual): Representing high-concurrency network services. 🐦

Database:

Firebase Firestore: Used for persistent storage of user-specific data, including installed apps, file system content, and browser history. 🔥

How to Interact 👆

Launch the OS: The main index.html file (provided in neural-os-final immersive) loads the entire simulated OS. ▶️

Navigate: Click on app icons on the home screen to launch different applications. 🖱️

Interact within Apps: Use buttons, input fields, and other UI elements within each app to perform actions. ✍️

Back to Home: Most apps include a "Back to Home" button to return to the main app launcher. ↩️

Persistence: Changes made within the Notes app, Play Store (installations), File System (create/edit/delete), and Browser (history) are saved and will persist when you refresh the page or return later. ✨

This project showcases how a modern, multi-tiered operating system could conceptually leverage AI and various programming languages for different functionalities, all orchestrated by a central UI layer.
